    <p>
        The <span class="bold">Data Plotter</span> is a tool for plotting data received over a serial port. Typical use cases include microcontroller-based SDI (Software-defined instruments), such as an oscilloscope based on STM32 MCU, or data logging from sensors connected to Arduino.
    </p>
    <h2>Communication Protocol</h2>
    <p>
        The communication protocol aims to be as simple as possible to facilitate implementation on the MCU firmware side. Data transmission can occur in either binary format or as text.
    </p>
    <h2>Capabilities</h2>
    <p>
        Similar to oscilloscopes, <span class="bold">DataPlotter</span> can plot data, perform FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) and automatic measurements, and save data to CSV files or as images. It also features cursors and XY modes. The plot can function in either oscilloscope mode, receiving data as an array of samples captured over a short period, or in rolling mode, receiving data point-by-point and continuously appending it to previous data over a long duration. Support for logic (digital) channels is also included.
    </p>
    <h2>Instrument Control</h2>
    <p>
        Various methods are available for controlling the instrument from the DataPlotter:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            An ANSI terminal emulator that supports escape sequences, enabling the creation of a pseudo-graphical UI for displaying measured data and settings. It features interactive elements, such as clickable characters with colorful backgrounds that send specific commands to the instrument.
        </li>
        <li>
            Dynamic creation of instrument controls via QML (QtQuick language), allowing for almost endless customization possibilities. The QML code can be sent to DataPlotter by the instrument, showcasing a new GUI tailored to the user's needs.
        </li>
    </ul>
